## Session 2026-02-19 (2nd) - Coding Agent

### Completed Features:
- Feature #16: Responsive sidebar collapse on mobile - PASSING
  - Verified existing mobile sidebar implementation via Playwright browser automation
  - At <768px: desktop sidebar hidden, hamburger icon appears in topbar
  - Hamburger opens slide-in overlay (w-[260px]) with full navigation
  - Overlay closes via: hamburger/X button, backdrop click, bottom bar Menu button, navigation
  - Bottom bar provides quick access to Dashboard, Contacts, Chats, and Menu toggle
  - Auto-closes sidebar when navigating to a new page (useEffect on location change)
  - No code changes needed - feature was already fully implemented

### Environment Notes:
- Server running on port 5001 (pre-existing from earlier session)
- Raspberry Pi database unreachable (API calls timeout) - only affects data features, not UI
- Playwright browser automation working via /home/gabriel/.npm-global/bin/playwright-cli
- Used test-auth.html workaround to set localStorage for auth bypass (since API was timing out)

### Current Status:
- 10/207 features passing (9 at session start, +1 this session)
- Feature #16 marked passing after thorough browser verification

## Session 2026-02-19 (3rd) - Coding Agent

### Completed Features:
- Feature #14: Top bar with user avatar, dark mode toggle, notifications indicator - PASSING
  - All three top bar elements already implemented in Topbar.tsx
  - User avatar shows initials (e.g. "GF" for Gabriel Fronza) with AvatarFallback
  - Dark mode toggle works: Moon icon in light mode, Sun icon in dark mode
  - Notifications badge shows count (blue circle with number)
  - Enhanced useSession.ts to sync user.fullName and user.avatarUrl to localStorage
  - Verified via Playwright: dark mode toggle switches theme, avatar shows initials, badge shows "3"
  - Zero console errors

### Code Changes:
- client/src/hooks/useSession.ts: Added localStorage sync for user name and avatar URL
  - Previously only synced email, role, and account ID
  - Now also syncs fullName and avatarUrl for avatar display in topbar

### Environment Notes:
- Server on port 5001 (pre-existing from earlier sessions)
- DB unreachable (API timeout) - used dev-login.html for auth bypass
- Playwright working via npx playwright-cli

### Current Status:
- 11/207 features passing (10 at session start, +1 this session)
- Feature #14 marked passing after browser verification
- Git commit: 1fa1f6e

  - 220ms fade-in + 10px slide-up animation on page mount
  - Uses GPU-accelerated properties (opacity, transform) with will-change hint
  - Custom cubic-bezier easing [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1] for smooth feel
  - Verified across 6 pages: Dashboard, Campaigns, Contacts, Calendar, Tags, Dashboard
  - No layout shift, no jank, no JS console errors from transition code
  - Zero mock data patterns

### Code Changes:
- NEW: client/src/components/crm/PageTransition.tsx - Reusable transition wrapper
- MODIFIED: client/src/components/crm/CrmShell.tsx - Wrapped {children} with PageTransition

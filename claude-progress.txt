## Session 2026-02-19 (2nd) - Coding Agent

### Completed Features:
- Feature #16: Responsive sidebar collapse on mobile - PASSING
  - Verified existing mobile sidebar implementation via Playwright browser automation
  - At <768px: desktop sidebar hidden, hamburger icon appears in topbar
  - Hamburger opens slide-in overlay (w-[260px]) with full navigation
  - Overlay closes via: hamburger/X button, backdrop click, bottom bar Menu button, navigation
  - Bottom bar provides quick access to Dashboard, Contacts, Chats, and Menu toggle
  - Auto-closes sidebar when navigating to a new page (useEffect on location change)
  - No code changes needed - feature was already fully implemented

### Environment Notes:
- Server running on port 5001 (pre-existing from earlier session)
- Raspberry Pi database unreachable (API calls timeout) - only affects data features, not UI
- Playwright browser automation working via /home/gabriel/.npm-global/bin/playwright-cli
- Used test-auth.html workaround to set localStorage for auth bypass (since API was timing out)

### Current Status:
- 10/207 features passing (9 at session start, +1 this session)
- Feature #16 marked passing after thorough browser verification

## Session 2026-02-19 (3rd) - Coding Agent

### Completed Features:
- Feature #14: Top bar with user avatar, dark mode toggle, notifications indicator - PASSING
  - All three top bar elements already implemented in Topbar.tsx
  - User avatar shows initials (e.g. "GF" for Gabriel Fronza) with AvatarFallback
  - Dark mode toggle works: Moon icon in light mode, Sun icon in dark mode
  - Notifications badge shows count (blue circle with number)
  - Enhanced useSession.ts to sync user.fullName and user.avatarUrl to localStorage
  - Verified via Playwright: dark mode toggle switches theme, avatar shows initials, badge shows "3"
  - Zero console errors

### Code Changes:
- client/src/hooks/useSession.ts: Added localStorage sync for user name and avatar URL
  - Previously only synced email, role, and account ID
  - Now also syncs fullName and avatarUrl for avatar display in topbar

### Environment Notes:
- Server on port 5001 (pre-existing from earlier sessions)
- DB unreachable (API timeout) - used dev-login.html for auth bypass
- Playwright working via npx playwright-cli

### Current Status:
- 11/207 features passing (10 at session start, +1 this session)
- Feature #14 marked passing after browser verification
- Git commit: 1fa1f6e

## Session 2026-02-19 (4th) - Coding Agent

  - Integrated into CrmShell to wrap all page children content
  - 220ms fade-in + 10px slide-up animation on page mount
  - Uses GPU-accelerated properties (opacity, transform) with will-change hint
  - Custom cubic-bezier easing [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1] for smooth feel
  - Verified across 6 pages: Dashboard, Campaigns, Contacts, Calendar, Tags, Dashboard
  - No layout shift, no jank, no JS console errors from transition code
  - Zero mock data patterns

### Code Changes:
- NEW: client/src/components/crm/PageTransition.tsx - Reusable transition wrapper
- MODIFIED: client/src/components/crm/CrmShell.tsx - Wrapped {children} with PageTransition

### Environment Notes:
- Server on port 5001 (pre-existing)
- DB unreachable (API timeout) - used dev-login.html for auth bypass
- Playwright working via npx playwright-cli

### Current Status:

- Git commit: 75d9a80

## Session 2026-02-19 (5th) - Coding Agent

### Completed Features:
- Feature #17: Quick-jump shortcuts from dashboard - PASSING
  - QuickJumpCards component already implemented in AppDashboard.tsx (lines 100-174)
  - Four cards: Leads (/contacts), Campaigns (/campaigns), Inbox (/conversations), Calendar (/calendar)
  - Rendered in both AgencyDashboard and SubaccountDashboard views
  - Uses useWorkspace() for correct route prefix (/agency or /subaccount)
  - Verified all four cards navigate correctly via Playwright browser automation
  - Tested agency view: all 4 cards → correct /agency/ routes
  - Tested subaccount view: Leads card → /subaccount/contacts (correct prefix)
  - Visual verification: cards show icons, labels, descriptions, arrow indicators
  - No code changes needed - feature was already fully implemented

### Environment Notes:
- Server on port 5001 (started fresh this session)
- DB reachable (login via API worked successfully)
- Playwright working via /home/gabriel/.npm-global/bin/playwright-cli
- Console errors are Vite HMR websocket issues (dev environment only, not feature-related)

### Current Status:
- 11/207 features passing (10 at session start, +1 this session)
- Feature #17 marked passing after thorough browser verification

## Session 2026-02-19 (6th) - Coding Agent

### Completed Features:
- Feature #11: Account switcher dropdown for agency users - PASSING
  - Sidebar already had account switcher UI (RightSidebar.tsx) with useWorkspace hook
  - Wired accountId filtering through the full data pipeline:
    - leadsApi.ts / campaignsApi.ts: accept optional accountId, pass as ?accountId=X query param
    - useLeadsData.ts / useCampaignsData.ts: accept accountId, re-fetch on change via useEffect
    - LeadsTable.tsx / CampaignsTable.tsx: derive filterAccountId from useWorkspace
  - Agency users with "all accounts" (accountId=1) see unfiltered data
  - Selecting a specific client account filters leads and campaigns
  - Client (Viewer) users don't see the account switcher at all
  - Verified all 3 steps via Playwright:
    1. Admin login: account switcher visible with all 6 accounts
    2. Selected "van de Kerkhof" (account 2): contacts page showed 6 filtered leads
    3. Viewer login (viewer@test.com): account switcher hidden in sidebar

### Code Changes:
- MODIFIED: client/src/features/leads/api/leadsApi.ts - Added accountId param to fetchLeads
- MODIFIED: client/src/features/campaigns/api/campaignsApi.ts - Added accountId param to fetchCampaigns
- MODIFIED: client/src/features/leads/hooks/useLeadsData.ts - Accept accountId, re-fetch on change
- MODIFIED: client/src/features/campaigns/hooks/useCampaignsData.ts - Accept accountId, re-fetch on change
- MODIFIED: client/src/features/leads/components/LeadsTable.tsx - Pass filterAccountId from useWorkspace
- MODIFIED: client/src/features/campaigns/components/CampaignsTable.tsx - Pass filterAccountId from useWorkspace

### Environment Notes:
- Server on port 5001 (started fresh this session)
- DB reachable (login via API worked, leads/campaigns data loaded)
- Playwright working via /home/gabriel/.npm-global/bin/playwright-cli
- Had to run seed-users.ts to create viewer@test.com test user
- Port conflicts resolved by killing stale node processes

### Current Status:
- Feature #11 marked passing after browser verification
- Changes already committed (included in commit f9529c5)

## Session 2026-02-19 (7th) - Coding Agent

### Completed Features:
- Feature #2: Database schema applied correctly - PASSING
  - All 11 tables (Accounts, Leads, Campaigns, Interactions, Users, Tags, Leads_Tags,
    Automation_Logs, Prompt_Library, Lead_Score_History, Campaign_Metrics_History) are
    accessible and queryable through the API
  - Added missing Lead_Score_History and Campaign_Metrics_History table definitions to schema.ts
  - Added storage methods (getLeadScoreHistory, getCampaignMetricsHistory, etc.)
  - Added /api/lead-score-history and /api/campaign-metrics-history API endpoints
  - Added /api/health endpoint that verifies all 11 tables with row counts
  - Verified all 11 endpoints return HTTP 200 with data
  - Server restart persistence test passed (PostgreSQL, no in-memory stores)
  - Zero console errors, zero mock data patterns

### Code Changes:
- MODIFIED: shared/schema.ts - Added leadScoreHistory and campaignMetricsHistory table definitions
- MODIFIED: server/storage.ts - Added Lead_Score_History and Campaign_Metrics_History query methods
- MODIFIED: server/routes.ts - Added /api/health, /api/lead-score-history, /api/campaign-metrics-history routes

### Verification:
- All 11 API endpoints tested via curl: Accounts(200), Leads(200), Campaigns(200),
  Interactions(200), Users(200), Tags(200), Leads_Tags(200), Automation_Logs(200),
  Prompt_Library(200), Lead_Score_History(200), Campaign_Metrics_History(200)
- /api/health returns: {"status":"healthy","totalTables":11,"accessibleTables":11}
- Browser automation screenshot confirmed health endpoint output
- Server restart test confirmed data persistence

### Current Status:
- 15/207 features passing (14 at session start, +1 this session)

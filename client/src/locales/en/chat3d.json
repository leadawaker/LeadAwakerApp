    "sophie1": "Hey Jack, it's Sophie from Peak Creative. You made a website upgrade inquiry last July. Ready to move forward?",
    "sophie2": "Still on your radar? 😊",
    "sophie3": "No worries, life happens! What was the main blocker? Budget, timeline, or other fires?",
    "jack1": "Hi Sophie! Yes sorry, summer was crazy with client launches. The website is definitely still something I need.",
    "jack2": "Honestly a bit of all three. I need something that looks pro but doesn't take forever or cost a fortune.",
    "jack3": "I've seen some of your portfolio work and I really like the style, just a bit concerned about the investment side of things.",
    "jack4": "Yes that works, for me that call would work great tomorrow. What times do you have?",
    "jack5": "I am good, thanks for reaching out :)",
    "sophie4": "I completely hear you Jack. We actually specialize in high-impact builds that balance that 'pro' look with efficiency. That's exactly why I'd love for you to have a quick call with one of our strategists. They can look at your specific needs and show you how we can make the budget work without compromising on quality.",
    "sophie5": "You can select a time in our calendar page: [link]. I'll pass our conversation notes so our team has everything prepped. You will be in good hands Jack!",
    "sophie6": "Your call is booked for tomorrow at 3:30pm, if you have any questions or need to re-schedule, just let me know 😊",
    "sophie7": "You are welcome, have a great day"

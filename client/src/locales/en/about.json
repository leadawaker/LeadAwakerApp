            "q": "What results can we realistically expect?",
            "a": "Based on industry benchmarks and publicly observed results from similar lead reactivation and conversational outreach systems, re-engagement rates commonly range between 5–15% within the first 30 days. These figures are indicative, not guarantees. Actual performance depends on factors such as lead quality, offer relevance, timing, channel selection, and campaign configuration."

          {
            "q": "Is this a replacement for our sales team?",
            "a": "No. Lead Awaker is designed to support and scale your sales efforts, not replace them. The system handles initial outreach, follow-ups, and qualification, allowing your sales team to focus on high-intent conversations and closing."

          {
            "q": "What happens when a lead responds?",
            "a": "When a lead replies, the system evaluates intent and readiness. Depending on your configuration, it may book a call directly into your calendar, hand the conversation off to your sales team with full context, or continue nurturing until the lead is ready for human follow-up."
          },
          {
            "q": "What if our leads are really old or completely cold?",
            "a": "Age alone is not the main factor; relevance is. Leads that are 6 months or even 2 years old can still convert if the original problem or need still exists and the outreach feels contextual and personal. The system focuses on engagement signals and response behavior rather than database age."
          },
          {
            "q": "Will this work with our industry or niche?",
            "a": "Lead Awaker adapts to different sales processes and industries, including B2B and service-based businesses. During setup, the system is configured to reflect your terminology, offerings, common objections, and qualification logic so it fits your specific market."

          {
            "q": "How do you avoid coming across as spam or pushy?",
            "a": "Messages are sent contextually based on where each lead left off in the funnel, using natural language instead of generic templates. Outreach respects pacing, relevance, and opt-out signals, aiming to feel like a thoughtful follow-up rather than a mass campaign."
          },
          {
            "q": "Do we need to provide scripts or does the AI write everything?",
            "a": "Providing scripts is optional. You may share examples of your best-performing conversations, brand guidelines, or key talking points. The system adapts this input into personalized messages, with tone and positioning aligned during setup."
          },
          {
            "q": "Can we review or approve messages before launch?",
            "a": "Yes. Before any campaign goes live, you can review messaging examples, tone, positioning, and qualification logic. Nothing is deployed without alignment on how the system communicates on your behalf."
          },
          {
            "q": "Can we pause or adjust campaigns mid-run?",
            "a": "Yes. Campaigns can be paused, adjusted, or refined at any time. Messaging, targeting rules, and qualification criteria can be updated without losing active conversation context."

            "a": "Channels may include WhatsApp, SMS, Instagram, or other messaging platforms depending on your audience, technical feasibility, platform policies, and compliance requirements. Channel selection and prioritization are defined during setup."
          },
          {
            "q": "How do you handle compliance (GDPR, CAN-SPAM, CCPA)?",
            "a": "Lead Awaker operates with compliance-oriented workflows such as opt-out handling, consent-aware messaging logic, and respectful outreach patterns. Clients remain responsible for the origin of their leads and the legal basis for contact. The system executes campaigns according to client instructions and applicable regulations."
          },
          {
            "q": "What happens if leads complain or opt out?",
            "a": "Opt-out requests are respected immediately and those leads are excluded from further outreach. If complaints occur, campaigns can be adjusted or paused while messaging, targeting, or cadence is reviewed to ensure respectful communication."

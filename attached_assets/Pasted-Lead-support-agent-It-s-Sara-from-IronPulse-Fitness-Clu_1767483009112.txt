It’s Sara from IronPulse Fitness Club here. Is this the same Vito who used to be a member at our gym in the last couple of years? 🙂

Gabriel Fronza:
yes that was me, its been quite a while ago

Lead support agent:
Nice! My manager asked me to reach out but I didnt want to spam you.

Are you still looking?

Gabriel Fronza:
I happen to be, I was really into it but then my baby girl was born and since then I was not able to get back into it

Lead support agent:
Awesome Vito, congrats on your baby girl! Let’s get you back into a good groove with the gym 🙂

Thinking about your new routine, how many days a week could you realistically come in, and do you see yourself more in classes, on machines, or with free weights?

Gabriel Fronza:
now that my baby goes to daycare, I have more time during the day. I was interested in kickboxing and doing some weight lifting

Lead support agent:
Nice, that’s great timing now that daycare has freed up your days a bit.

We’re really good at helping busy parents get back on track with flexible options. Would you be up for a quick call to go over kickboxing and lifting options together?

Gabriel Fronza:
my main issue is that I need some personal trainer support, I find it hard to know if I am making progress and I get demotivated easily if not

Lead support agent:
I totally get that, staying motivated and knowing you’re progressing is huge, especially getting back in after a break.

We’ve got trainers who track your progress for you and keep you accountable with clear, simple goals. Would you be open to a quick call so our specialist can walk you through personal training options that fit your schedule?

Gabriel Fronza:
yeah I guess, I would be open to it

Lead support agent:
Great! Here's my calendar: https://calendar.app.google/uvWx5JWm7SLZSCqz7

Pick a time that suits you in the next few days and our gym specialist will call to chat about PT, kickboxing and weights.

Just checking in 😊  
Were you able to find a time on the calendar link, or would you prefer I offer a couple time options?

Awesome Vito 🎉 You’re set for this Monday at 7:00 pm.

Our advisor will call you then to go over personal training, kickboxing and a plan that keeps you motivated.

Anything else or need to reshedule, just let me know!

Gabriel Fronza:
that is all thanks a lot!

Lead support agent:
You’re welcome, have a great day 🙂

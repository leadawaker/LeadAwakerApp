To set up the glow and shadows for the cards exactly as they are in this prototype, you can use these specific CSS techniques and Tailwind classes. I've broken them down into the two distinct layers used: the dynamic outer glow and the elevated card shadow.

1. The Dynamic "Bloom" Glow
The "glow" that appears behind the card when it's active is created using a separate div placed behind the card content with a high blur value.

HTML Structure:
<div className="relative">
  {/* Glow Layer */}
  <div className={`absolute inset-0 rounded-xl blur-3xl transition-opacity duration-500 
    ${isActive ? 'bg-purple-400/40 opacity-100' : 'opacity-0'}`} 
  />
  
  {/* Card Content */}
  <div className="relative bg-white border-2 rounded-xl ...">
    ...
  </div>
</div>
How it works:
blur-3xl: This applies a 64px Gaussian blur to the background color.
bg-purple-400/40: Using a low opacity (40%) color prevents the glow from looking "muddy" or too solid.
transition-opacity: Smoothly fades the glow in and out as the workflow moves.
2. The Multi-Layered Card Shadow
For the cards themselves, I used a "High-End Elevation" shadow profile. Instead of a standard flat shadow, this uses a multi-stop shadow that includes the accent color.

The Shadow Config (Tailwind):
/* Purple Active State */
shadow-[0_20px_50px_-12px_rgba(168,85,247,0.6)]
/* Standard/Inactive State */
shadow-[0_8px_30px_rgba(0,0,0,0.2)]
Deep Dive into the Values:
Offset (0px 20px): Pushes the shadow down to create a sense of height (elevation).
Blur (50px): A very wide spread makes the shadow feel soft and modern rather than "harsh."
Spread (-12px): This is the "secret sauce." A negative spread pulls the shadow inward at the edges, making it look cleaner and more professional.
Color Matching: Using the brand color (e.g., rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.6)) instead of pure black for the shadow makes the card feel like it's actually emitting light onto the surface below.
3. The Subtle Internal Gradient
To add extra depth, each card has a card-gradient-overlay that creates a "surface texture":

.card-gradient-overlay {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
  border-radius: inherit;
  background: linear-gradient(to top left, rgba(55, 65, 81, 0.07), transparent 70%);
}
This adds a very faint 7% dark tint to the bottom-right corner, making the white card look less "flat" and more like a physical object.

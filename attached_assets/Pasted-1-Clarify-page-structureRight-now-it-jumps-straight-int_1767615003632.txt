1. Clarify page structureRight now it jumps straight into “Meet the Founder” with a dense grid. Consider this structure instead:Short page intro above the founder block:Add a small eyebrow + heading + one-liner.Example:Eyebrow: ABOUT LEAD AWAKERH1: Turning sleeping leads into your easiest winsSubcopy: Lead Awaker is built for businesses that already have leads, but not enough time to follow up on every single one with care.Then keep your current “Meet the Founder” block, but rename:Change Our Mission to Mission & Beliefs or Why Lead Awaker Exists so it feels like a continuation of that intro rather than a random section.Code-wise, just wrap the top with something like:<div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-16 text-center">
  <p className="text-xs font-semibold tracking-[0.2em] text-primary mb-3 uppercase">
    About Lead Awaker
  </p>
  <h1 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-3">
    Turning sleeping leads into your easiest wins
  </h1>
  <p className="text-sm md:text-base text-muted-foreground">
    Built for teams sitting on a goldmine of past inquiries and quotes, but not enough time to follow up personally with every single one.
  </p>
</div>2. Make the founder grid less “CV-like”The 4 cards read like a résumé, not like a story of “why this matters to you.” Adjust in three ways:Rename and reframe titles to benefits:“Software Development” → “Reliable technical backbone”“Data Analysis & Trading” → “Performance-obsessed problem solving”“AI Automation” → “Done-for-you automation, not more tools”“Current Focus” → “Where Lead Awaker is going next”Turn some bullets into client-relevant value, not just career history. For example:{
  icon: <Code2 className="w-6 h-6 text-primary" />,
  title: "Reliable technical backbone",
  items: [
    "10+ years shipping production software across games and film",
    "Experience at Framestore, Sega, New World Interactive",
    "Knows how to keep complex systems simple and stable for non-technical teams"
  ]
}Reduce bullet count per card to 3–4 lines, increase font size from text-xs to text-sm for readability:<li
  key={idx}
  className="text-sm text-muted-foreground flex items-start gap-2"
>
  <span className="text-primary mt-1">•</span>
  <span>{item}</span>
</li>3. Align mission copy with your “goldmine” angleYou already like the goldmine analogy and prefer “personalized/caring” over “human‑like.”��Replace the mission paragraph block with something closer to:<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-center">
  Our Mission
</h2>
<p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground text-center mb-6">
  Most businesses sit on a goldmine of sleeping leads. You paid for them, they showed interest, then life got in the way.
</p>
<p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground text-center">
  At Lead Awaker, the mission is to wake up those dormant leads with personalized, caring conversations that make your brand look like the hero, so you grow without endlessly buying more clicks.
</p>That ties directly into the LeadReactivationAnimation and your brand name without sounding generic.�4. Visually balance the animation and sectionsTo avoid the page feeling disjointed:Place LeadReactivationAnimation directly under the new hero intro, before “Meet the Founder.”Add consistent spacing tokens:Use mb-16 or mb-20 between major sections (founder, mission, FAQ) so the rhythm is even.Lightly separate sections with subtle borders or dividers:E.g., wrap FAQ in border-t border-border pt-12 to feel like a distinct block.Example section order in JSX:<div className="min-h-screen pt-24 pb-20">
  <div className="container mx-auto px-4 md:px-6">
    {/* Intro */}
    {/* LeadReactivationAnimation */}
    {/* Meet the founder grid */}
    {/* Mission */}
    {/* FAQ */}
  </div>
</div>5. Tighten FAQ tone and specificsThe FAQ is structurally good but reads a bit placeholder-y:Make pricing answer more concrete even if you keep “custom quote”:E.g. “Most clients invest between X and Y depending on list size and channels.”Make the setup answer show empathy for busy teams:“You keep running your business; onboarding is handled.”Example tweaks:{
  q: "What's the setup time?",
  a: "Most setups take 2–5 days depending on your CRM and list size. You keep running your business; the team handles the integrations and workflows for you."
},
{
  q: "How much does it cost?",
  a: "Pricing starts from a simple, custom quote. Most clients choose a performance‑based model tied to reactivated revenue, with no upfront setup fees."
}If you want, next step can be: paste your updated copy and layout idea and this can be refined line‑by‑line for tone so it feels even more “personal, caring, and making you look good” instead of technical.

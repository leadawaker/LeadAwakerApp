Hi, it’s Jennifer from Dragon Wok Kitchen here

Is this the same Steve that made an inquiry via email about booking a table at our restaurant last week? 🙂

Gabriel Fronza:
Yes it was me about 2 weeks ago I think

Lead support agent:
Nice! My manager asked me to reach out but I didnt want to spam you.

Are you still looking?

Gabriel Fronza:
yup, the wife's bday is coming up soon and perhaps your venue would be a nice place to celebrate

Lead support agent:
Awesom Steve! 🎉 Let’s get your wife’s birthday celebration set at Dragon Wok.

Would you like to reserve a private table for the birthday dinner?

Gabriel Fronza:
I suppose, do you guys do anything special for bdays?

Lead support agent:
Nice, birthday dinners are popular here for couples and families.

We can add a little dessert surprise and help with a nice table setup; what day were you thinking of coming in?

Gabriel Fronza:
her bday is this Thursday

Lead support agent:
This Thursday works, we get lots of birthday dinners that night.

We’re experts in making things easy for your celebration and keeping it affordable. Shall we lock in a reservation time for this Thursday?

Gabriel Fronza:
yes

Lead support agent:

Anything else or need to reschedule, just let me know!

Gabriel Fronza:
awesome, thanks!

Lead support agent:
You’re welcome, have a great day 🙂

Gabriel Fronza:
oh by the way, I realized I have to pick up my kid from school at that time, can I book for another time?

Lead support agent:
No worries at all, we can totally shift that booking for you.

What time this Thursday would suit you better for the birthday dinner?

Gabriel Fronza:
5pm

Lead support agent:
Perfet, I’ll move your reservation to this Thursday at 5:00 PM instead.

We’ll be ready for your birthday dinner then, including a nice table setup.

Anything else or need to tweak the time again, just tell me!

ah thanks for the flexibility, have a good day

Pleasure Steve, enjoy the birthday dinner and have a great day 🙂

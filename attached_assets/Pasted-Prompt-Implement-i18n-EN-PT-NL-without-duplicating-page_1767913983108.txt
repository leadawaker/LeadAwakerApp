Prompt: Implement i18n (EN/PT/NL) without duplicating pagesYou are editing my existing codebase. I already have a language selector button (English, Portuguese, Dutch). Please implement a maintainable internationalization system with these requirements:GoalSupport en, pt, nl across the whole website.Do not create duplicate pages like services-pt.tsx or home-nl.tsx.Keep one TSX file per page (e.g. keep services.tsx) and move all user-facing text into translation files/messages.��Routing / URL behaviorUse locale-based routing so pages can be accessed as /en/..., /pt/..., /nl/... (or the equivalent supported by this project).When the user switches language via the button, the site should:change the active locale,update the URL accordingly,keep the user on the same page path (only locale changes).�Translations structureCreate message files per locale and per page/namespace (recommended), e.g.:en/services.json, pt/services.json, nl/services.json (or the equivalent directory structure used by the chosen i18n library).�Use stable translation keys (no inline hardcoded strings inside components).�Component changesRefactor services.tsx (and at least the home page as a proof) so all visible strings come from t('...') / translations.My services.tsx contains a CASES array with long chat messages. Translate those too:Keep the message structure in TSX (type, sender, time, ids),But load the content strings from translations (e.g. t('cases.solar.messages.m1')).��FallbacksDefault language: English.If a key is missing in pt or nl, fall back to English.�DeliverablesShow me the exact file/folder changes you made.Provide the updated code for:the language switcher handler,i18n config,one fully translated page (home),and services.tsx refactored to use translation keys.Provide example translation JSON files for EN/PT/NL with enough keys to demonstrate the full flow.Before you start, detect whether this project is Next.js (App Router or Pages Router) or a plain React/Vite + Wouter style app, and implement the appropriate i18n approach accordingly, without duplicating pages.��

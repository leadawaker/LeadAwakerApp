 Keep the overall visual identity (clean, modern, teal‑based) but implement the following **very specific structural, visual, and animation changes** to the current layout.

### 1. Overall page structure (top to bottom)

Maintain these sections in this order, updating each as described:

1. Hero section  
2. “Manual Reactivation Is Broken” problem section  
3. “Your Expert Sales Rep in 3 Steps” merged with “How It Works” as a scrollable story  
4. “Your Conversion Pipeline in Action” card grid with scroll‑driven animation  
5. Metrics section with “From Chaos to Passive Revenue in 30 Days” and a line chart  
6. Integrations (merged with Step 1 / Map the Process)  
7. Security & AI guardrails  
8. FAQ teaser with link to full FAQ page  
9. Demo CTA at the bottom

Use smooth scrolling and modern, subtle motion throughout. Where specified, use **“section locking”**: the viewport stays fixed on that section while internal elements animate as the user scrolls; scrolling back up reverses those animations.

***

### 2. Background and global feel

- The **hero section** uses a clean, light background (similar to the current design).  
- Starting from the **“Manual Reactivation Is Broken”** section, introduce a **night‑to‑dusk gradient** that changes smoothly as users scroll toward the middle “solution” part of the page:
  - Top of this region (at the problem section): deep navy / dark teal gradient, e.g. from approximately `#020820` to `#003344`.  
  - By the time the user reaches the **middle solution area** (3‑step section and pipeline), the background should have smoothly transitioned into a **teal → soft orange dusk glow**, e.g. `#007F82` blending into `#FF7A3C`.  
- Make this gradient change **smoothly with scroll**, not in abrupt jumps.

***

### 3. Hero section (hero first)

Keep the hero as the very first section, but refine it:

- Left side:  
  - H1: “Convert dead leads into booked sales automatically.”  
  - Subheadline: one concise sentence about AI‑driven SMS that reactivates dormant leads.  
  - Primary CTA button (e.g. “Book a Demo”) and secondary CTA (e.g. “See it in action”).  
- Right side: a large **3D chat/SMS card** representing an example conversation (similar to the existing green chat screenshot). Implement:

  - The card is **tilted in subtle perspective**, as if hovering above the page at a slight angle (around 5–10 degrees), with a soft shadow beneath to reinforce the 3D effect.  
  - When the hero comes into view, **auto‑play** an animation where the chat bubbles appear one after another from the bottom, with a brief pause between each.  
  - End the sequence with the **typing / dotted message indicator** as if the lead is about to reply to the last question.  
  - The full interaction should **not require much scrolling** to complete; it should play quickly and naturally as soon as the card is visible.  
  - On scroll back up, the bubble sequence can either replay or reset gracefully.

Make this hero responsive: on mobile, stack headline above the chat card while keeping the same animations in a simplified form.

***

### 4. “Manual Reactivation Is Broken” section (problem)

- Keep this section near the top, **after the hero**, and use it as the point where the **night gradient begins**.  
- Maintain the idea of the problem tiles (bloated CRMs, low reply rates, burnout, etc.) but ensure they stand out clearly against the darker night background.  
- No complex animations needed here beyond subtle fades/slide‑ins; this section sets the “pain” context before showing the solution.

***

### 5. “Your Expert Sales Rep in 3 Steps” + “How It Works” (merged scroll story)

Merge “Your Expert Sales Rep in 3 Steps” and “How It Works” into **one scroll‑driven story section** with section locking and alternating card/image layout.

#### General behavior

- Title at the start of this combined section:  
  - Main heading: “Your Expert Sales Rep in 3 Steps.”  
  - Subheading: “Dead leads → revenue.”  
- As the user scrolls into this section, **lock the viewport** and reveal each step sequentially.  
- For each step:
  1. First state: show the step number card and an accompanying image.  
  2. As the user scrolls a bit further while still locked, apply a **dark teal overlay** on the image, reduce its brightness, and fade in **additional explanatory copy on top of the image**.  
  3. Once fully revealed, keep the step static and then unlock scroll to move to the next step.  
- Scrolling back up should reverse these animations in a smooth way.

#### Step 1 – left card, right image

- Layout:  
  - Left: Step 1 card.  
  - Right: image and overlay.  
- Step 1 card content:  
  - Title: “Upload database.”  
  - Short line: “AI instantly IDs high‑potential dormant leads.”  
- Integrated “How It Works” copy for Step 1 (use in overlay text):  
  - “Map the Process – We analyze your current sales workflow and identify bottlenecks.”  
- Right image: abstract or light schematic showing data/upload/CRM or stack connections, fitting the brand.  
- Under/next to this step (still part of Step 1), incorporate the **Seamless Integration** idea in a more sophisticated way:
  - Remove emojis.  
  - Show a row of sleek, minimal icons with labels:  
    - “CRM / Databases”  
    - “WhatsApp, SMS & Chat”  
    - “Email Platforms”  
    - “Calendar Apps”  
  - Style these icons in brand colors or monochrome with subtle hover or fade‑in animations.  
  - This integrations row should feel like part of the Step 1 content, not a separate block.

#### Step 2 – right card, left image

- Layout:  
  - Right: Step 2 card.  
  - Left: image + overlay.  
- Step 2 card content:  
  - Title: “Chat GPT‑5.2 conversations.”  
  - Subline: “Natural, tailored messages per niche and lead (not robot templates).”  
- Overlay text over the image when scrolled further:  
  - “Build the Automations – Set up AI agents, workflows, and integrations in minutes.”  
- Left image: a lifestyle shot or illustration of a lead (e.g. someone in their living room, holding a phone and replying to SMS), styled to match the site.  
- Same behavior: first show clean card + image, then overlay appears with teal tint and detailed text as the scroll advances.

#### Step 3 – left card, right image

- Layout:  
  - Left: Step 3 card.  
  - Right: image + overlay.  
- Step 3 card content:  
  - Title: “Optimize Weekly.”  
  - Subline: “Test, tune and scale winning flows.”  
  - This **replaces** any “Revenue rolls in” phrasing.  
- Overlay text for the image: can repeat or expand “Optimize Weekly – Test, tune and scale winning flows. Monitor performance and continuously improve conversion rates.”  
- Right image: an analytics/overview dashboard style graphic (charts, metrics) that aligns with the optimization theme.  
- After Step 3 completes and remains visible for a moment, allow the user to scroll down out of this locked section into the **Conversion Pipeline** section.

***

### 6. “Your Conversion Pipeline in Action” section

Use the existing 4‑row card grid but add new **colors and scroll‑driven card motion**. This section should also use section locking while its animation plays.

#### Layout

- Keep the title: “Your Conversion Pipeline in Action.”  
- Keep four horizontal rows:

  - Row 1: 📫 Leads Engaged  
  - Row 2: 📩 Lead Replied  
  - Row 3: ✅ Lead Qualified  
  - Row 4: 👍 Lead Booked  

- Each row has a colored header pill on the left and 2–3 lead cards in a white box aligned to the right, similar to the current design.

#### Header colors

Update the header pill backgrounds to use **subtle gradients** that get warmer as you go down:

- Leads Engaged: dark teal gradient (e.g. from `#005566` to `#007F82`).  
- Lead Replied: brighter teal gradient (e.g. `#008F9C` to `#00B3B8`).  
- Lead Qualified: gradient transitioning toward warm tones, e.g. `#00B3B8` to `#FF9A3C`.  
- Lead Booked: keep close to the current warm/orange style, possibly a gradient from `#FF9A3C` to `#FF7A3C`.

#### Scroll‑driven card animation

Implement an animation where **specific lead cards move down one stage at a time**, and scrolling back up reverses this:

- Lock the viewport on this section when it enters.  
- On downward scroll, perform these card moves in sequence (with short easing animations between each step):

  1. The **second card** from “Leads Engaged” slides downward into the “Lead Replied” row.  
  2. The **third card** from “Lead Replied” slides downward into the “Lead Qualified” row.  
  3. **Two cards** from “Lead Qualified” slide downward into the “Lead Booked” row.

- When a card moves down into a row, the existing cards in that row **shift slightly to the right**, as if making space, but still remaining **within the white box** (no cards fully leave the container).  
- Each move should be clearly visible, with smooth motion, but not overly long.  
- When the user scrolls **back up**, these moves reverse in the opposite order so the pipeline visually “undoes” and cards move back up to their previous category.  
- After the final animation is done, unlock scroll to allow the user to continue down to the metrics section.

***

### 7. Metrics + “From Chaos to Passive Revenue in 30 Days” section

Replace the current “Within 30 Days” header with a stronger central message and rearrange metrics.

#### Content and layout

- Remove the “Within 30 Days” title.  
- Place a central box that now reads:  
  - “From Chaos to Passive Revenue in 30 Days.”  
- Around or below this box, show the four key metrics, but **reformat them into two columns and two rows** (2×2 grid):  
  - “40–60% Reply Rates (vs industry 5–10%)”  
  - “15–25% Leads reactivated into opportunities”  
  - “40+ Hours saved per rep/month”  
  - “$0 Upfront cost (performance pricing)”

- Next to this 2×2 metrics grid (on the right on desktop, below on mobile), add a sophisticated **line chart image or illustration** representing improvement over time:
  - Use the brand colors (teal and warm accent) for the line and accents.  
  - The line could represent reply rate or bookings increasing over time.  

#### Animation

- When this section scrolls into view, gently animate the line chart:
  - The line draws itself from left to right.  
  - Bars or points (if any) can ease up from the x‑axis.  
- Keep the animation **gentle and non‑looping** or loop very slowly without being distracting.

***

### 8. Security & AI guardrails section

Toward the end of the page, before the FAQ teaser or after the metrics/pipeline depending on what reads best, add a dedicated **Security and Reputation** band.

- Heading: something like “Security, Compliance, and Reputation Built In.”  
- Underneath, show a **single row of 3–4 pillars**, each with a small icon and short description. Example pillars:
  - “Data Protection – Encrypted data handling and restricted access.”  
  - “Compliance – Built with GDPR/CCPA‑friendly practices in mind.”  
  - “AI Guardrails – Safety filters and controls on every interaction.”  
  - “Sender Reputation – Protects your brand from spammy outreach.”

Style this section with a slightly darker or more “trustworthy” background and clean, minimal icons (no emojis).

***

### 9. FAQ teaser section

Keep a **short FAQ teaser** instead of a long list.

- Heading: “Frequently Asked Questions.”  
- Show only **3–4 key questions** from the current FAQ (e.g. setup time, CRM support, pricing, compliance).  
- Each question can still expand in an accordion.  
- Below, add a clear link/button: “View all FAQs” that leads to a dedicated full FAQ page where all questions are listed.

This keeps the main page focused while still addressing top objections.

***

### 10. Bottom demo CTA

At the very bottom of the page, after the FAQ teaser and/or security section:

- Add a strong final CTA section, echoing the hero:  
  - Headline: e.g. “Ready to convert your dead leads into booked sales?”  
  - Subline: short reassurance about setup speed and performance‑based pricing.  
  - Primary button: “Book a Demo.”  
- Use a layout and style consistent with the hero but simpler, maybe with a subtle glow or background element to make it stand out.

***

### 11. General style and polish

- Maintain the existing typography, logo, and general spacing, but make the page feel more dynamic and premium through:
  - Smooth scroll transitions and easing on all animations.  
  - Consistent use of teal and orange accents drawn from the night→dusk gradient.  
  - Subtle shadows and layering, particularly around interactive cards (hero chat, pipeline, metrics).  
- Ensure all animations are performant and do not require excessive scrolling to progress. Avoid overly long or distracting loops.

Apply all of these changes to the **current iteration** of the site design, respecting the existing brand identity while elevating the page with the described layouts, colors, and scroll‑based animations.

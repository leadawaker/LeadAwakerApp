The blend mode is set correctly, so the issue is likely the stacking / background behind the clouds, not Replit or React.What’s blocking the blendmix-blend-mode: screen blends the image with whatever is directly behind it in the same stacking context. ��Your cloud wrapper has className="absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 ... z-0" and style={{ isolation: 'isolate' }}, while the glow background and starfield also use absolute inset-0 with zIndex: 0 or no explicit z-index.Because of this:The clouds may be on top of a transparent area or above a layer with the same color as the clouds, so “screen” visually looks like “normal”. �isolation: isolate creates a new stacking context, which means the clouds are blending only with that isolated element’s backdrop, not with the starry / glow layers you expect. �Quick fixes to tryRemove isolation and control z-index explicitly<div 
  className="absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 pointer-events-none h-[500px] overflow-hidden opacity-80"
  // remove isolation here
>
  <motion.div className="flex h-full w-[200%]">
    <img
      src={cloudsOverlay}
      className="w-1/2 h-full object-contain object-bottom"
      style={{ mixBlendMode: 'screen' }}
    />
    <img
      src={cloudsOverlay}
      className="w-1/2 h-full object-contain object-bottom"
      style={{ mixBlendMode: 'screen' }}
    />
  </motion.div>
</div>Then set the layers so the clouds sit above the gradients, but below the content:{/* Sky gradients */}
<div className="absolute inset-0 -z-20" ... />   // stars
<div className="absolute inset-0 -z-10" ... />   // glow

{/* Clouds */}
<div className="absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 z-0" ...> ... </div>

{/* Foreground content */}
<div className="relative z-10"> ... </div>Ensure there is a solid/background gradient where the clouds areRight now the lower 25vh is a linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 0%, #F4F5F9 100%) with zIndex: 5. That gradient is above your clouds (zIndex: 5 vs z-0), so the clouds may actually be hidden behind it.Try lowering that gradient:<div
  className="absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 pointer-events-none"
  style={{ background: 'linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 0%, #F4F5F9 100%)', height: '25vh', zIndex: -5 }}
/>This way, the clouds blend with the blue/purple sky, not sit under a white gradient.Test with a strong blend modeTo confirm it is blending, temporarily switch to something obvious:style={{ mixBlendMode: 'difference' }}If “difference” visibly changes compared with “normal”, you know blending works and it was just the background / stacking. �If you share a screenshot after these tweaks, the exact stacking order can be refined further, but these three changes usually fix “mix-blend-mode looks like normal” in layered hero sections.

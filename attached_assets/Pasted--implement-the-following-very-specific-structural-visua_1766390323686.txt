 implement the following very specific structural, visual, and animation changes to the current layout.1. Overall page structure (top to bottom)Maintain these sections in this order, updating each as described:Hero section“Manual Reactivation Is Broken” problem section“Your Expert Sales Rep in 3 Steps” merged with “How It Works” as a scrollable story“Your Conversion Pipeline in Action” card grid with scroll‑driven animationMetrics section with “From Chaos to Passive Revenue in 30 Days” and a line chartIntegrations (merged with Step 1 / Map the Process)Security & AI guardrailsFAQ teaser with link to full FAQ pageDemo CTA at the bottomUse smooth scrolling and modern, subtle motion throughout. Where specified, use “section locking”: the viewport stays fixed on that section while internal elements animate as the user scrolls; scrolling back up reverses those animations.2. Background and global feelThe hero section uses a clean, light background (similar to the current design).Starting from the “Manual Reactivation Is Broken” section, introduce a night‑to‑dusk gradient that changes smoothly as users scroll toward the middle “solution” part of the page:Top of this region (at the problem section): deep navy / dark teal gradient, e.g. from approximately #020820 to #003344.By the time the user reaches the middle solution area (3‑step section and pipeline), the background should have smoothly transitioned into a teal → soft orange dusk glow, e.g. #007F82 blending into #FF7A3C.Make this gradient change smoothly with scroll, not in abrupt jumps.3. Hero section (hero first)Keep the hero as the very first section, but refine it:Left side:H1: “Convert dead leads into booked sales automatically.”Subheadline: one concise sentence about AI‑driven SMS that reactivates dormant leads.Primary CTA button (e.g. “Book a Demo”) and secondary CTA (e.g. “See it in action”).Right side: a large 3D chat/SMS card representing an example conversation (similar to the existing green chat screenshot). Implement:The card is tilted in subtle perspective, as if hovering above the page at a slight angle (around 5–10 degrees), with a soft shadow beneath to reinforce the 3D effect.When the hero comes into view, auto‑play an animation where the chat bubbles appear one after another from the bottom, with a brief pause between each.End the sequence with the typing / dotted message indicator as if the lead is about to reply to the last question.The full interaction should not require much scrolling to complete; it should play quickly and naturally as soon as the card is visible.On scroll back up, the bubble sequence can either replay or reset gracefully.Make this hero responsive: on mobile, stack headline above the chat card while keeping the same animations in a simplified form.

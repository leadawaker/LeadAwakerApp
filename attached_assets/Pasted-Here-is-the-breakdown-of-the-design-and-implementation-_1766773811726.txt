Here is the breakdown of the design and implementation details I used for the AI Workflow visualization. You can share these specific prompts and technical details with your AI builder:

1. The Moving Connection Line
The Prompt: "Create a SVG connection line between nodes that uses a 'quick glow' animation. The line should normally be a subtle gray (#d1d5db), but when a trigger occurs, it should flash white (#ffffff) with a strong white drop-shadow blur, then fade back to gray. Use CSS keyframes for a lineQuickGlow effect (0.4s) and a lineFadeBack effect (0.8s)."

The Logic:

Placement: Absolute positioned SVG covering the canvas.
Animation: Triggered by React state (isGlowing, isFadingBack) that switches CSS classes on the <line> element.
2. The Light, Bright Glow
The Prompt: "Each node should have a 'glow' layer underneath it. Use a div with absolute inset-0, a very high blur-3xl, and an opacity of about 40%. The color should match the node's theme (e.g., bg-amber-400/40 for yellow, bg-purple-400/40 for purple). Transition the opacity over 500ms so it appears to breathe or light up when the node becomes active."

3. Security Status Texts
I used a sequence of technical but readable status updates to make the guardrails feel like they are actively "scanning" the content.
The Sequence:

verifying...
No violations
On-topic sales
Clean content
Clean language
No personal data
No credentials
No unauthorized links
No Data Leakage
Message Sent (Final success state)
4. Circles (Indicators) Around Nodes
The Prompt: "Add small circular 'port' indicators on the edges of the cards where the lines connect. These should be 12px circles with a 2px white border. When the node is active, the circle should scale up (scale-125) and add a glowing shadow (e.g., shadow-[0_0_10px_rgba(245,158,11,0.8)]). When inactive or visited, they should be a semi-transparent version of the node color."

5. Node Typography & Formatting
The Format:

Card Container: bg-white, border-2, rounded-xl, p-6, w-64.
Primary Title: font-bold, text-sm, text-gray-900.
Secondary Label (ID/Version): text-[10px], text-gray-400, uppercase, tracking-wider, font-semibold.
Status Box: A bg-gray-50 inner container with a font-mono label and right-aligned dynamic text.
Active Border: I used a custom SVG overlay with a stroke-dasharray and a strokeRotate keyframe animation to create that 'marching ants' moving border effect around the active node.
I've ensured the frontend is fully updated and the workflow is restarted so you can see these details in action.

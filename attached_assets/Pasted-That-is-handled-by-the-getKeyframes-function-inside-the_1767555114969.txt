That is handled by the getKeyframes function inside the Cursor component. Instead of just moving from point A to point B, it generates a set of intermediate coordinate arrays based on a randomly selected "path type."

Here is the specific block of code that handles those "non-straight" movements:

const getKeyframes = () => {
  // ... early returns for clicking/disappearing ...
  
  const halfwayX = randomConfig.halfwayOffset.x;
  const halfwayY = randomConfig.halfwayOffset.y;
  switch(randomConfig.pathType) {
    case 1: // Curved: Adds a single arc via a halfway point
      return {
        x: [0, halfwayX, randomConfig.jitterX, 0],
        y: [0, halfwayY, randomConfig.jitterY, 0],
      };
    case 2: // Erratic: Moves back and forth (zags) before settling
      return {
        x: [0, halfwayX, -randomConfig.jitterX * 0.8, randomConfig.jitterX, 0],
        y: [0, -halfwayY * 0.5, randomConfig.jitterY, -randomConfig.jitterY * 0.3, 0],
      };
    case 3: // Spiral/Overshoot: Swings wide (overshoots) then pulls back
      return {
        x: [0, halfwayX * 1.5, -randomConfig.jitterX, randomConfig.jitterX * 0.5, 0],
        y: [0, -halfwayY, randomConfig.jitterY * 1.2, 0],
      };
    default: // Subtle: A slight wobble rather than a pure straight line
      return {
        x: [0, halfwayX * 0.2, randomConfig.jitterX, 0],
        y: [0, halfwayY * 0.2, randomConfig.jitterY, 0],
      };
  }
};
Why this works:
Keyframe Arrays: By passing an array [0, offset, 0] to Framer Motion, we're telling it to start at the origin, move to a "jitter" point mid-flight, and then return to the origin (which is the button center).
Bezier Easing: The parent container uses a cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1) transition. The 1.56 value creates an overshoot effect, making the hands feel like they have physical momentum as they "snap" onto the button.
Random Path Selection: Because randomConfig.pathType is decided once when the hand "spawns," each cursor follows its own unique trajectory (e.g., one might spiral in while another zigs and zags).
